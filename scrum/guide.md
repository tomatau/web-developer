# The Scrum Guide

https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html

**Scrum**: a *framework* for addressing *complex problems* whilst *productively and creatively* produce *products* of the *highest value*.
```
- Lightweight
- Easy to understand
- Difficult to master
```

Used for complex problems since the 1990s.

It's not a process, technique, or definitive method.

A framework where you employ various process' and techniques.

Facilitate continuously improving the product, team, and working environment.

Scrum has roles, events, and artifacts. Each serve a specific purpose and is essential.

Rules of Scrum bind the components together. Govern relationships and interaction between them.

## Uses of Scrum

Originally for managing and developing products. Has also been used to:

- Research and identify viable markets, technologies, and product capabilities.
- Develop products and enhancements.
- Release enhancements multiple times daily.
- Develop cloud and operational environments.
- Renew and sustain products.

Used for:

- Hardware
- Software
- Schools
- Vehicles
- Government
- Marketing
- Individual management

Valuable in iterative and incremental knowledge transfer.

The **essence of Scrum**: A small team of people. Highly flexibly and adaptive. The flexibility and adaptivity can scale from one to many teams. The team develop, release, operate, and sustain work for thousands of people. Collaborate and interoperate through development architectures and release environments.

> "Develop" and "Development" refer to complex work.

## Scrum Theory

Founded on *empirical process control theory*, or empiricism.

> Knowledge comes from from experience and making decisions based on what is known.

Scrum employs iterative and incremental approach to:
- optimize predictability
- control risk

Three pillars:
- Transparency
- Inspection
- Adaptation

### Transparency

Aspects of the process must be *visible* to those *responsible for the outcome*. Those aspects must be defined by a common standard, so observers share a *common understanding*.

- Common language referring to the process.
- People completing work and people inspecting work share definition of done.

### Inspection

Scrum users must frequently inspect artifacts and progress towards sprint goal. Look for undesirable variances.

Don't let inspections get in the way of work.

Inspect diligently by skilled inspectors at a point in work.

Scrum prescribes 4 formal events for inspection and adaptation:

- Sprint Planning
- Daily scrum
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective

### Adaptation

If process deviates too much or the product isn't good enough. The process or material being processed must be *adjusted as soon as possible* to minimize further deviation.

## Scrum Values

- commitment : do the right thing
- courage : work on tough problems
- openness : between team and stakeholders about work and challenges
- focus : on sprint goals and scrum team goals
- respect : team members to be capable and independent

Leads to the 3 pillars (somehow) and builds trust.

> This sounds like a cult.

## Scrum Team

Self organizing and cross functional.

- Choose how to best accomplish their work.
  - outsiders can't direct
- Have all of the competencies to complete the work without depending on others

The team consists of: Product Owner, Development Team, and Scrum Master.

The model is designed for flexibility, creativity, and productivity.

Delivery is incremental and iterative to maximize opportunity for feedback. Incremental deliveries of "done" ensures potentially useful version of work is always available.

### The Product Owner

Responsibilities:

- Maximizing the value of the product the development team create.
- Sole person managing product backlog

Approach to "maximizing" value can vary widely across organizations, teams, and individuals.

Managing backlog involves:

- Expressing backlog items
- Ordering items to best achieve goals
- Optimizing the value of work the development team performs
- Ensure the backlog is visible, transparent, and clear
- Display what the scrum team works on next
- Ensure the development team understands items in the backlog to level needed

The product owner can do the work, or delegate to development team. Product Owner is accountable for it.

Product owner is one person. They can represent the desires of a committee. Anyone wishing to change backlog must go through product owner.

Organization must respect product owner's decisions. The decisions are visible in the ordering of backlog. Development team must work on requirements set by product owner.

### The Development Team

Work on potentially releasable increment of "done" product at the end of each sprint.

A "done" increment is required at the sprint review.

Only the development team can create the increment.

The development teams are structured and "empowered" (what?) by the organization to organize and manage their own work. Optimize efficiency and effectiveness.

Team characteristics:

- Self organizing : No one tells them how to turn backlog items into increments.
- Cross functional : all skills necessary to create product increment.
- No titles for development team members.
- No sub-teams. E.g. testing, architecture, operations, business analysis..
- Accountability belongs to whole development team despite specialized skills of individuals.

#### Development Team Size

> Small enough to be nimble
> Large enough to complete work

Fewer than 3 members decreases interaction and results in smaller productivity. Smaller teams may have skill constraints and be unable to deliver a "done" (releasable) increment.

More than 9 members requires too much coordination. Large teams create complexity for empirical process.

Product Owner and Scrum Master roles aren't included in the count unless they also execute work on the Sprint Backlog.

### The Scrum Master

Responsibilities:
- promoting and supporting Scrum as per the guide
- help everyone understand: theory, practices, rules, and values
- help people outside of the team understand which interactions with the team are helpful and which aren't
- help change interactions between team and outside to maximise value created by the team

A servant-leader for the Scrum Team.

**Service to the Product Owner**

- Ensuring the goals, scope, and product domain are understood by everyone on the team.
- Finding techniques for effective backlog management.
- Helping the team understand the need for clear and concise backlog items.
- Understand planning and empirical environment.
- Ensure the product owner knows how to arrange backlog items for maximal value.
- Understanding and practicing agility.
- Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed.

**Service to the Development Team**

- Coaching in self-organization and cross-functionality.
- Helping the team create high-value products.
- Removing impediments to progress.
- Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed.
- Coaching the team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood.

**Service to the Organization**

- Leading and coaching organization in Scrum adoption.
- Planning scrum implementations.
- Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product development.
- Causing change that increases productivity of teams.
- Working with other scrum masters to increase effectiveness of scrum in organization.

## Scrum Events

Create regularity and minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum.

All events are time-boxed, they all have maximum duration.

Once a sprint begins, it cannot change its length.

Other events can end whenever their purpose is accomplished.

Sprint contains other events.

Events are formal, for inspecting and adapting.

Designed for critical transparency and inspection.

Skipping any events results in reduced transparency and a lost opportunity to inspect and adapt.

### The Sprint

Time boxed of one month or less.

A "Done", usable and potentially releasable product increment is created.

Durations are consistent.

New sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

Contain consistent:
- Sprint planning
- Daily Scrums
- Development work
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective

During a sprint:
- No changes that endanger the sprint goal.
- Quality goals do not decrease.
- Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between product owner and development team.

Each sprint can be considered a project, with:
- goal to accomplish something
- plan to guide building it
- the work
- the resulting product increment

Limited to one calendar month.

Too long and: the definition of what's being built can change, complexity and risk can increase.

Enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation towards goal.

Limit the maximum cost of risk to one month.

#### Cancelling a Sprint

Can be cancelled before timebox is over.

Only product owner has authority (maybe under influence of stakeholders, the development team or scrum master).

Cancel if the goal becomes obsolete.
- change in company direction
- market conditions change
- technology conditions change

When cancelled:
- "done" items are reviewed.
- Product owner typically accepts a release
- incomplete items are re-estimated and put back on the backlog

Sprint cancellations consume resources, e.g. regrouping into another sprint planning.

#### Sprint Planning

Created by the collaborative work of the entire scrum team.

Time boxed to 8 hours for a one-month sprint. Shorter sprints need shorter planning.

Scrum master ensures the event takes place and attendants understand the purpose. Teach the team to stay within the time-box.

Planning answers these questions:
- What can be delivered in the increment?
- How will the work be achieved?

**What can be delivered in the increment?**

Development team forecast the functionality.

Product owner discusses objective and backlog items for that objective.

Only the development team can assess what they can accomplish over the sprint.

Team craft the sprint goal. An objective that provides guidance to the development team on why they're building the increment.

**How will the work be achieved?**

Development team decides how to make "done".

Product backlog items + plan = the sprint backlog.

Development team usually starts by designing the system and work needed.

Work is varying size or estimated effort.

Plan enough work that can be done in the sprint. duh?

Decompose the work into units of one day or less if possible.

Development team self organizes the work in the sprint backlog during planning and the sprint.

Product owner can help clarify items and make trade-offs.

With too much or too little work, development team renegotiate with the product owner.

Development team can invite other people to attend or provide technical or domain advice.

The development team should be able to explain how they will achieve the sprint goal.

#### Sprint Goal

Objective for a sprint.

Gives guidance to the development team on why they're building the increment.

Gives some flexibility regarding the functionality implemented within the spring.

The selected product backlog items deliver one coherent function.

Sprint goal can be any other coherence that cause the development team to work together rather than on separate initiatives.

If the work turns out to be different than anticipated, the development team collaborate with the product owner to renegotiate the scope of the sprint backlog.

### Daily Scrum

15 minute time boxed event for the development team.

Held at the same time every day of the sprint to reduce complexity.

During the scrum, the development team plans work for the next 24 hours.

Goal is to optimize team collaboration and performance through inspection and forecasting.

Inspect progress towards the goal.
Inspect how progress is trending towards completing the work in the sprint backlog.

Optimize probability that the development team will meet the sprint goal.

Development team should understand how they intend to work together.

The structure can be conducted in different ways. Can be answering questions or discussion based.

Examples:
- What did I do yesterday the helped the team meet the goal?
- Will will I do today to help        "   "    "    "   "  ?
- Are there any potential impediments for me or the team?

The development team (or whole team) often meet after the scrum for detailed discussion:
- to adapt
- replan

Scrum master ensures the team has the meeting.

Development team is responsible for conducting the daily scrum.

Scrum master teaches team to stau within time box.

It's an internal meeting for the development team. If others are present, the scrum master ensures that others do not disrupt the meeting.

Intentions:
- improve communications
- eliminate other meetings
- identify impediments to remove
- highlight and promote quick decision making
- improve development team's level of knowledge

A key "inspect and adapt" meeting.

### Sprint Review

Held at the end of a sprint to inspect the increment and adapt the product backlog.

Scrum team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the sprint.
- collaborate on the next things that can be done to optimize value

An informal meeting, not a status meeting.

The presentation of the meeting is to elicit feedback and foster collaboration.

Time-boxed at four-hours for a one month sprint. Shorter for shorter sprints.

Scrum master ensures the event takes place and that attendees understand the purpose.

Teach everyone to keep within time-box.

Includes following elements:
- involves scrum team and key stakeholders invited by the product owner.
- product owner explains which backlog items have been "done" and what not.
- development team discuss what went well, what problems, how problems were solved.
- development team demonstrates the work that was "done" and answers questions.
- product owner discusses the backlog.
- product owner projects target and delivery dates based on progress.
- entire group collaborates on what to do next.
- review provides input to the sprint planning.
- review of how marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed what is most valuable.
- review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, marketplace

Result of the review is a revised product backlog with highlighted probable backlog items for the next sprint.

Adjust the backlog to meet new opportunities.

### Sprint Retrospective

Opportunity for scrum team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next sprint.

Occurs after the sprint review and before the next sprint planning.

Time-boxed to 3 hours for a one month sprint. Shorter for shorter sprints.

Scrum master ensures the event takes place and people understand the purpose.

Scrum master ensures the meeting is positive and productive.

Scrum master teaches all to keep it time-boxed.

Scrum master participates as a "peer" team member in the meeting.

Purpose:
- Inspect how the sprint went regarding: people, relationships, process, and tools.
- Identify and order the items that went well and potential improvements.
- Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the team works.

Scrum master encourages the team to improve within the scrum framework.

Make scrum more effective and enjoyable for the next sprint.

Team plans ways to increase product quality by improving work processes or adapting the definition of "done".

> don't conflict with organization's definition of done.

Identify improvements to implement in the next sprint. Adaptation to inspection of the scrum team itself.

Formal opportunity to focus on inspection and adaptation.

## Scrum Artifacts

Represent work or value.

Provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation.

Specifically designed to maximize transparency of key information, so that everyone has the same understanding of the artifact.

### Product Backlog

An ordered list of everything known to be needed in the product.

Single source of requirements for changes to be made to the product.

Product owner is responsible for it, it's content, availability, and ordering.

Product backlog is never complete.

Earliest version lays the initially known and best-understood requirements.

Evolves as the product and environment for it evolve.

Dynamic; constantly changes to identify the products needs, to be: competitive, and useful.

A list of all features, functions, requirements, enhancements and fixes. Changes to be made to product in future releases.

Each item has:
- description
- order
- estimate
- value
- optionally: test description that prove completeness when "done"

As a product is used, the marketplace provides feedback. This feedback increases the backlog size.

Requirements never stop changing, so the backlog is a living artifact.

Changes in business requirements, market conditions, and technology, can lead to item changes.

Multiple scrum teams can work together on the same product. One backlog is for this product. Items can have an attribute that groups them together.

Backlog refinement is the act of:
- adding detail
- estimates
- ordering
- reviewing and refining

An ongoing process which the product owner and development team collaborate on the details of items.

The scrum team decides when and how the refinement is done.

Refinement consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the development team.

Product owner can update the items at any time.

Higher ordered items are clearer and more detailed than lower ordered items.

More precise estimates based on greater clarity and increased detail.

Backlog items going into a sprint are refined so that the item can be reasonably "done".

If an item can be completed within a sprint, it's "ready" for selection in sprint planning.

Items acquire transparency through refining activities.

Development team is responsible for all estimates.

Product owner can influence the development team by helping them understand and select trade-offs. Development team still make the final estimate.

#### Monitoring Progress Toward Goals

At any point in time, total remaining work for the goal can be summed.

Product Owner tracks the total work remaining at least at every sprint review.

Product Owner compares work remaining with previous sprint reviews to assess progress toward completing projected work.

Progress toward completing projected work is transparent to all stakeholders.

Practices to forecast progress:
- burn downs
- burn ups
- cumulative flows

Empiricism is more important

Can't know what will happen, only what has happened.

### Sprint Backlog

Set of product backlog items selected for the sprint, plus a plan for delivering the increment.

A forecast by the development team about what functionality will be in the increment and what is required to get there.

Makes visible all the work necessary work identified by the development team.

To ensure continuous improvement, it includes at least one process improvement (identified in the retrospective).

It contains enough detail so that changes in progress can be understood in the daily scrum.

Development team modifies the sprint backlog throughout the sprint.

As new work is required, the development team adds it to the backlog.

As work is completed, the estimated remaining work is updated.

When elements of the plan are deemed unnecessary, they are removed.

Only the development team can change the sprint during the sprint.

The sprint backlog is visible and belongs solely to the development team.

#### Monitoring Sprint Progress

At any point in time, total remaining work for the sprint can be summed.

The development team tracks this estimate at least for every daily scrum. To project the likelihood of achieving the goal.

So the development team can track progress.

### Increment

Sum of all the backlog items completed during a sprint and the value of all previous incremements.

At the end of a sprint, the increment must be "done". It must be in a useable condition. Regardless of whether it's released or not.

Body of inspectable, done work.

A step toward a vision or goal.

## Artifact Transparency

Decisions to optimize value and control risk are made based on the state of artifacts.

If the transparency is throughout, the decisions have a sound basis.

If there is anything missing from the artifacts, or they are not completely transparent, the decisions can be flawed.

Flawed decisions have greater risk.

Scum Master works with Product Owner, Development Team, and other involved parties to understand if the artifacts are completely transparent.

If the Scrum Master observes incomplete transparency, they must help everyone improve transparency.

A Scrum Master can detect incomplete transparency by inspecting the artifacts, sensing patterns, listening to claims, and detecting differences between expected and real results.

Scrum Master's job is to work with the Scrum Team and organization to increase transparency of artifacts.

To do this, use learning, convincing, and change.

### Definition of "Done"

Everyone must understand what "done" means.

The definition may vary per Scrum Team.

Must be a shared understanding of what it is for work to be complete, to ensure transparency.

Definition of "done" for Scrum Team and is used to assess when work is complete on the product increment.

Same definition guides the development team in knowing how many product backlog items it can select during a sprint.

If the definition of "done" for an increment is part of the conventions, standards or guidelines of the development organization -- all teams must follow it as a minimum.

If the definition of done isn't part of the development organization, the development team of the Scrum Team must define a definition of "Done" appropriate for the product.

If multiple teams work on a system or product release, the development teams on all scrum teams must mutually agree a definition of "Done".

Each increment is additive to previous increments, and tested to ensure all increments work together.

As scrum teams mature, definitions of "done" will expand to include more stringent criteria for a higher quality.

New definitions of "done" can uncover new work to be undertaken on previously "done" increments.
